            <p>
              <br />
              Hi there, I'm Felipe, a talented tattoo artist from Brazil, and
              you can find me on Instagram as @guildtattoo_! I've been working
              in this industry for 3 years and have a vast background in
              drawing, which makes me a true master of my craft. Although my
              passion lies in blackwork tattoos, I'm skilled in any style and
              can bring your vision to life.
              <br />
              <br />
              Not only am I meticulous when it comes to detail and design, but I
              also prioritize the comfort of my clients. That's why I offer numb
              pomade to help minimize any pain during the tattoo process.
              Whether you prefer to visit my studio or have me come to your
              home, I'm dedicated to providing you with the best possible
              experience.
              <br />
              <br />
              But don't just take my word for it, head over to my Instagram page
              and check out my impressive portfolio to see my work for yourself.
              And if you're interested in getting a tattoo, make sure to book an
              appointment with me soon before my schedule fills up!
            </p>
